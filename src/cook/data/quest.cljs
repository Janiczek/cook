(def start "As soon as you get reasonably close, the Cook grabs you by the hand: \"Young traveler, you must help me!\"

\"What's the problem,\" you ask.

The Cook sobs: \"I'm in a terrible mess! It's the Duke's birthday today, and I should be making him a huge birthday cake using special ingredients... but I've forgotten to get them! Will you help me, please?\"

You open your mouth: \"Well... I--\"

\"That's absolutely amazing! Thank you!! So, I need a super large egg, top-quality milk and some extra fine flour. You should have no problem finding the ingredients somewhere near Lumbridge,\" the Cook pours out everything that's on his mind.

\"But...\"

\"Thanks again!!\" The Cook says, turns to his cooking range and seems to not notice you anymore.")

(def cook-ingredients? "The Cook looks at you impatiently: \"Oh, it's you! So, how is it going? Do you have the ingredients yet?\"")

(def not-yet "You shake your head. \"Sorry, not yet.\"

\"Well, hurry then!\" the Cook barks at you.")

(def yes-complete "You nod: \"Oh yes! Here you are!\"

You hand the ingredients to the Cook.
                          
The Cook seems ecstatic. \"You have saved me!! Thank you!! The Duke will be so happy!\"

You raise your eyebrow: \"Well, and what's in it for me?\"
                         
The Cook thinks a bit and then kisses you, in a truly Russian way. \"This will have to do!\"

But, because the Cook, in a hurry, forgot to brush his teeth this morning, this totally knocks you out of all your HP. You respawn just outside his window and land safely on some newb.
                          
CONGRATULATIONS, you won the game!")
